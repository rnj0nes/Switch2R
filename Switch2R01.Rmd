## 2014-2015 presentation series: Switch2R

- ![R icon](../ricon.jpg) 

    - is a *free* general purpose statistical software and programming language
    - is the lingua franca of statisticians
    - is eating the lunch of SAS and SPSS
    - learning is hard, so we're going to help each other and form a local R users group

---

 ![BRAUN logo](../logo-braun.png)
 
  - Narragansett Bay Area R Users
  - http://www.meetup.com/Narragansett-Bay-Area-R-Users/
  - BRAUN kick-off will be the second Switch2R/AMPHIBIAN meeting (November)
  - Why 
  
    + R User Groups are supportive environments
    + The closest R Users Group is in Boston
    + There has got to be some experienced R users in the area who can help us

```{r}
# Read data from UCLA Web site
url <- "http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/paperexamples/atkins_mlm/Atkins_JFP_data.txt"
data <- read.csv(url, sep="\t", header=TRUE)
# show the first six lines
head(data)
```

library(pipeR)
library(xtable)
library(plyr)

data %>>%
  {do.call(data.frame, 
           list(mean = apply(., 2, mean),
                sd = apply(., 2, sd),
                median = apply(., 2, median),
